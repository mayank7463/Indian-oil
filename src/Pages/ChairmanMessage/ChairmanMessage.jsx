                    consumers globally, the country’s oil
                    demand is projected to rise from 5.4 Million
                    barrels per day (bpd) in 2023 to 9.3 Million
                    bpd by 2040. Fulfilling this rising demand
                    will require augmenting the country’s
                    refining capacity progressively, from the
                    current 256.8 Million Metric Tonnes Per
                    Annum (MMTPA) to 450 MMTPA. In addition,
                    the country is set to add 50 GW of renewable
                    energy capacity annually, aiming to achieve
                    500 Gigawatt (GW) of installed renewable
                    capacity by 2030. As the energy needs of
                    an ascendant India rapidly grows, your

                water footprint through the implementation
                of innovative water management practices
                across our refineries. One notable example
                is the Mathura Refinery, which utilises water
                from a sewage treatment plant (STP) set
                up through a Public-Private-Partnership
                model at Laxmi Nagar. This initiative has
                significantly reduced the refinery’s fresh
                water intake, with the refinery currently
                receiving approximately 7 MLD of treated
                waste water, reducing its freshwater
                consumption by 50%.</p>
                <p className='py-4'>Similarly, Gujarat Refinery has adopted the
                use of treated wastewater from the Vadodara
                Municipal Corporation’s STP. Currently,
                the refinery receives approximately 17
                MLD of treated wastewater, reducing its
                freshwater intake by 25%. We plan to further
                enhance this initiative over the next couple
                of years, aiming to utilise 40 MLD of treated
                wastewater for industrial purposes.</p>
                <p className='py-4'>Our Haldia Refinery has also inked an MoU
                with Syama Prasad Mookerjee (SPM) Port to
                reuse treated wastewater from an upcoming
                4 MLD STP at Haldia. In the last five years,
                we have achieved total water savings of
                about 54 MLD. It is noteworthy that despite
                commissioning several major projects,
                the increase in industrial freshwater
                consumption at our refineries was limited
                to just 11 MLD, compared to a potential

                 <p className='text-[#f37126] font-bold py-4'>Embracing a Brighter Tomorrow</p>
                 <p className='py-4'>Bestowed with the mantle of being India’s
                    energy leader, your Company has been
                    pioneering India’s green energy transition
                    with several trailblazing initiatives. We
                    are thus working tenaciously to steer the
                    immense responsibility as well as harness
                    the emerging opportunities to gain the
                    ‘first-mover’ advantage.</p>
                <p className='py-4'>Your Company firmly believes that as
                    these technologies mature, we will be
                    able to scale up and fully capitalise on
                    the prospects, creating a positive outcome
                    for the Company, stakeholders, and the
                    nation. These investments will help secure
                    your Company’s leadership position as ‘The
                    Energy of India’ for years and decades to
                    come in a new era of low carbon future.</p>
                <p className='py-4'>Talking of the key elements, renewable
                        energy will be a major driver for
                        decarbonising India’s energy mix. Your
                        Company thus aims to enhance our
                        renewable energy capacity to 31 GW by
                        2030, primarily through solar and wind
                        projects.This expansion aligns with India’s
                        target to achieve 500 GW of installed renewable capacity by the same year.
                        With a conducive, robust ecosystem being
                        facilitated by the Government of India, the
                        adoption of renewable power, particularly
                        solar energy is expected to rise. In the last
                        decade, India’s total solar power installed
                        capacity grew almost 30 times to reach
                        around 84 GW. In this evolving landscape,
                        it makes perfect sense for your Company to
                        adapt and scale up efforts in the renewable
                        sector.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>In line with this goal, we are poised to
                        integrate renewable power into our refinery
                        operations. We are also energising our fuel
                        stations and installations with solar power.
                        Furthermore, in the realm of Compressed
                        Bio Gas (CBG), we are planning to set up
                        30 CBG plants nationwide this year. These
                        plants will contribute significantly to India’s
                        goal of producing 5 Million Tonnes of biogas
                        by 2030.</p>

                      <p className='py-4'>Hydrogen presents another key opportunity
                        for securing India’s energy needs and drive
                        the green mobility ambitions. To fulfill its
                        potential as the ‘fuel of the future’, we
                        are making significant strides in green
                        hydrogen, aiming for 50% of our hydrogen
                        consumption to be green by 2030. Our plan
                        involves setting up green hydrogen plants
                        across all refineries and propelling the
                        advent of Hydrogen mobility in the country.
                        We believe that as major users increase
                        their consumption, it will activate other
                        industries, reduce costs, and pave the way
                        for hydrogen mobility to gain traction in
                        the country.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>Fuelling future mobility is another critical
                        area as India takes major stride towards
                        its target of 30% EV market share by 2030.
                        Your Company is leading the charge by

                        and three-wheelers segment, with plans to
                        expand this avenue for heavy-duty vehicle
                        applications. This approach envisions to be
                        a game changer for the sector.</p>
                        <p className='py-4'>In addition to battery swapping, we see
                        battery manufacturing as another promising

                        cells for lithium-ion batteries, we aim
                        to open new opportunities and gain an
                        edge in this segment. Our collaboration
                        with Panasonic exemplifies our strategy
                        to collaborate with technology leaders to
                        shape the future of e-mobility in India.</p>

                            up our capacity, targeting an increase to
                            13 MMT and achieving a petrochemical
                            intensity index of 15% by 2030. This strategic

                            stability during volatile crude price cycles.
                            By integrating petrochemicals into our
